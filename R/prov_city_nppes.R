#' Search the NPPES NPI Public Registry
#'
#' @description The NPPES NPI Registry Public Search is a
#' free directory of all active National Provider Identifier
#' (NPI) records. Healthcare providers acquire their unique
#' 10-digit NPIs to identify themselves in a standard way
#' throughout their industry. After CMS supplies an NPI,
#' they publish the parts of the NPI record that have public
#' relevance, including the providerâ€™s name, taxonomy and
#' practice address. It enables you to search for providers
#' in the NPPES (National Plan and Provider Enumeration System.)
#' All information produced by the NPI Registry is provided in
#' accordance with the NPPES Data Dissemination Notice.
#' There is no charge to use the NPI Registry.
