# Revoked Providers & Suppliers

Information on providers and suppliers currently revoked from the
Medicare program.

### Details

The Revoked Medicare Providers and Suppliers dataset contains
information on providers and suppliers who are revoked and under a
current re-enrollment bar. This dataset includes provider and supplier
names, NPIs, revocation authorities pursuant to [42 CFR §
424.535](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-424/subpart-P/section-424.535),
revocation effective dates, and re-enrollment bar expiration dates. This
dataset is based on information gathered from the *Provider Enrollment,
Chain and Ownership System (PECOS)*.
