## Opting Out

Providers who do not wish to enroll in the Medicare program may
"opt-out", meaning neither they nor the beneficiary can bill Medicare
for services rendered.

Instead, a private contract between provider and beneficiary is signed,
neither party is reimbursed by Medicare and the beneficiary pays the
provider out-of-pocket.

To opt out, a provider must:

- Be of an **eligible specialty** type

- Submit an **opt-out affidavit** to Medicare

- Enter into a **private contract** with their Medicare patients

## Opt-Out Periods

Opt-out periods last for two years and cannot be terminated early unless
the provider is opting out for the very first time and terminates the
opt-out no later than 90 days after the opt-out period's effective date.
Opt-out statuses are effective for two years and automatically renew.

Providers may **NOT** opt-out if they intend to be a Medicare Advantage
(Part C) provider or furnish services covered by traditional Medicare
fee-for-service (Part B).
