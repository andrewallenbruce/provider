Additionally, data risk adjusted thus account difference underlying severity disease patient populations treated providers.

Medicare pays differently services provided facility setting versus freestanding physicians’ office (non-facility setting). services delivered facility setting, Medicare makes two payments, one physician’s professional fee one facility. services delivered facility (Place_Of_Srvc = ”F”), data Physician Practitioners Dataset generally represents physician’s professional fee include facility payment. exception services delivered Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs). cases, physician’s professional fee ASC’s fee represented Physician Practitioners Dataset. ASCs can identified using provider type. services delivered non-facility setting, physician’s office (Place_Of_Srvc = ”O”), Physician Practitioners Dataset represents complete payment service.  users try link data file public datasets, please aware particular Medicare populations included timeframes used file merged. example, efforts link Physician Practitioners Dataset data Part D prescription drug data need account fact beneficiaries FFS Part B coverage (thus included Physician Practitioners Dataset) Part D drug coverage (thus represented Part D data files). time, beneficiaries Part D coverage (thus included Part D data) FFS Part B coverage (thus included Physician Practitioners Dataset).
