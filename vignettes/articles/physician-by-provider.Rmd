 > *Information on services and procedures provided to Original Medicare (fee-for-service) Part B (Medical Insurance) beneficiaries by physicians and other healthcare professionals.*

<br>

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has prepared a public data set, the Provider Utilization and Payment Data Physician and Other Practitioners Dataset, with information on services and procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries by physicians and other healthcare professionals. The Physician and Other Practitioners Dataset contains information on utilization, payment (allowed amount and Medicare payment), and submitted charges organized by National Provider Identifier (NPI), Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code, and place of service. The data in the Physician and Other Practitioners dataset contains 100% final-action (i.e., all claim adjustments have been resolved) physician/supplier Part B non-institutional line items for the Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) population. Claims processed by Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetic, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) are not included in the Physician and Other Practitioners Dataset.

<br>

## Physician & Other Practitioners: **by Provider**

<br>

The **Provider** data subset provides information on use, payments, submitted charges and beneficiary demographic and health characteristics organized by National Provider Identifier (NPI). This dataset is based on information gathered from CMS administrative claims data for Original Medicare Part B beneficiaries available from the CMS Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse.

  * Data update frequency: **Annually**
  * Data source: **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services**
