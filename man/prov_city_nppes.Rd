\description{
The NPPES NPI Registry Public Search is a
free directory of all active National Provider Identifier
(NPI) records. Healthcare providers acquire their unique
10-digit NPIs to identify themselves in a standard way
throughout their industry. After CMS supplies an NPI,
they publish the parts of the NPI record that have public
relevance, including the providerâ€™s name, taxonomy and
practice address. It enables you to search for providers
in the NPPES (National Plan and Provider Enumeration System.)
All information produced by the NPI Registry is provided in
accordance with the NPPES Data Dissemination Notice.
There is no charge to use the NPI Registry.
