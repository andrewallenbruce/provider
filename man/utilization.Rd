\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

\code{\link[=utilization]{utilization()}} allows access to information on services and
procedures provided to Original Medicare (fee-for-service) Part B
beneficiaries by physicians and other healthcare professionals; aggregated
by provider, service and geography.
}
\section{By Provider}{

\strong{type =}\code{"provider"}:

The \strong{Provider} dataset allows the user access to data such as
services and procedures performed; charges submitted and payment received;
and beneficiary demographic and health characteristics for providers
treating Original Medicare (fee-for-service) Part B beneficiaries,
aggregated by year.
}

\section{By Provider and Service}{

\strong{type =}\code{"service"}:

The \strong{Provider and Service} dataset is aggregated by:
\enumerate{
\item Rendering provider's NPI
\item Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code
\item Place of Service (Facility or Non-facility)
}

There can be multiple records for a given NPI based on the number of
distinct HCPCS codes that were billed and where the services were
provided. Data have been aggregated based on the place of service
because separate fee schedules apply depending on whether the place
of service submitted on the claim is facility or non-facility.
}

\section{By Geography and Service}{

\strong{type =}\code{"geography"}:

The \strong{Geography and Service} dataset contains information on utilization,
allowed amount, Medicare payment, and submitted charges organized nationally
and state-wide by HCPCS code and place of service.
