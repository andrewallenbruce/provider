\item{country}{Country where provider is located.}

\item{specialty}{Provider specialty code reported on the largest number of
claims submitted.}

\item{par}{Identifies whether the provider participates in Medicare

non-participating provider may elect to accept Medicare allowed amounts
for some services and not accept Medicare allowed amounts for other

CMS to identify products, supplies and services not covered by the CPT
codes (such as ambulance services).}

\item{drug}{Identifies whether the HCPCS code for the specific service
furnished by the provider is a HCPCS listed on the Medicare Part B Drug
Average Sales Price (ASP) File.}

\description{
Information on services and procedures provided to
Original Medicare (fee-for-service) Part B (Medical Insurance)
beneficiaries by physicians and other healthcare professionals;
aggregated by provider and service.
}
\details{
The \strong{Provider and Service} dataset provides information on
services and procedures provided to Medicare (fee-for-service) Part B
beneficiaries by physicians and other healthcare professionals.

The data is based on information gathered from CMS administrative claims
data for Part B beneficiaries available from the CMS Chronic Conditions
Data Warehouse.

The spending and utilization data in the Physician and Other
Practitioners by Provider and Service Dataset are aggregated
to the following:
\enumerate{
\item the NPI for the performing provider,
\item the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code, and
\item the place of service (either facility or non-facility).
}

There can be multiple records for a given NPI based on the number of
distinct HCPCS codes that were billed and where the services were
provided. Data have been aggregated based on the place of service
because separate fee schedules apply depending on whether the place
of service submitted on the claim is facility or non-facility.
