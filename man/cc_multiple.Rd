\describe{
\item{Bene_MCC}{To classify MCC for each Medicare beneficiary, the 21 chronic conditions are counted and grouped into four categories (0-1, 2-3, 4-5 and 6 or more).}
\item{Prvlnc}{Prevalence estimates are calculated by taking the beneficiaries within the MCC category divided by the total number of beneficiaries in the fee-for-service population, expressed as a percentage.}
\item{Tot_Mdcr_Stdzd_Pymt_PC}{Medicare standardized spending includes total Medicare payments for all covered services in Parts A and B and is presented per beneficiary (i.e. per capita). Standardized payments are presented to allow for comparisons across geographic areas in health care use among beneficiaries.}
\item{Tot_Mdcr_Pymt_PC}{Medicare spending includes total Medicare payments for all covered services in Parts A and B and is presented per beneficiary (i.e. per capita).}
\item{Hosp_Readmsn_Rate}{Hospital readmissions are expressed as a percentage of all admissions. A 30-day readmission is defined as an admission to an acute care hospital for any cause within 30 days of discharge from an acute care hospital. Except when the patient died during the stay, each inpatient stay is classified as an index admission, a readmission, or both.}
\item{ER_Visits_Per_1000_Benes}{Emergency department visits are presented as the number of visits per 1,000 beneficiaries. ED visits include visits where the beneficiary was released from the outpatient setting and where the beneficiary was admitted to an inpatient setting.}

\item{year}{YYYY, calendar year of Medicare enrollment. 2007-2018 data is
currently available.}

\item{geo_level}{Geographic level of data; options are "National", "State",
and "County"}

\item{geo_desc}{The state and/or county where the Medicare beneficiary
resides. The values include the 50 United States, District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico or U.S. Virgin Islands. Data aggregated at the National level
are identified by "National'.}

\item{fips}{FIPS state and/or county code where the Medicare beneficiary
resides. The Bene_Geo_Cd will be blank for data aggregated at the National
level or for Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands.}

\item{age_level}{Identifies the age level of the population that the data has
been aggregated. A value of 'All' indicates the data in the row represents
all Fee-for-Service Medicare Beneficiaries. A value of '<65' or '65+'
indicates that the data is aggregated by the age of the Medicare
Beneficiaries at the end of the calendar year.}

\item{demo_level}{Identifies the demographic level of the population that the
data has been aggregated. A value of 'All' indicates the data in the row is
represents all Fee-for-Service Medicare beneficiaries. A value of 'Sex'
indicates that the data has been aggregated by the Medicare beneficiary's
sex. A value of 'Race' indicates that the data has been aggregated by the
Medicare beneficiary's race. A value of 'Dual Status' indicates that the
data has been aggregated by the Medicare beneficiary's dual eligibility
status.}

\item{demo_desc}{For Bene_Demo_Lvl='Sex', a beneficiary’s sex is classified
as Male or Female and is identified using information from the CMS
enrollment database. For Bene_Demo_Lvl='Race', the race/ethnicity
classifications are: Non-Hispanic White, Black or African American,
Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native. All
the chronic condition reports use the variable RTI_RACE_CD, which is
available on the Master Beneficiary Files in the CCW. For
Bene_Demo_Lvl='Dual Status', beneficiaries can be classified as 'Medicare &
Medicaid' or 'Medicare Only'. Beneficiares enrolled in both Medicare and
Medicaid are known as “dual eligibles.” Medicare beneficiaries are
classified as dual eligibles if in any month in the given calendar year
they were receiving full or partial Medicaid benefits.}

\item{clean_names}{Clean column names with {janitor}'s \code{clean_names()}
function; default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{lowercase}{Convert column names to lowercase; default is \code{TRUE}.}
