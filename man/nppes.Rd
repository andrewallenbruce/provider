\section{\strong{National Provider Identifier (NPI)}}{

Healthcare providers acquire their unique 10-digit NPIs to identify
themselves in a standard way throughout their industry. Once CMS supplies
an NPI, they publish the parts of the NPI record that have public relevance,
including the providerâ€™s name, taxonomy and practice address.
}

\section{\strong{Entity/Enumeration Type}}{

Two categories of health care providers exist for NPI enumeration purposes:

\strong{Type 1}: Individual providers may get an NPI as \emph{Entity Type 1}.

\emph{Sole Proprietorship}
A sole proprietor is one who does not conduct business as a corporation and,
thus, \strong{is not} an incorporated individual.

An \strong{incorporated individual} is an individual provider who forms and
conducts business under a corporation. This provider may have a Type 1 NPI
while the corporation has its own Type 2 NPI.

A solo practitioner is not necessarily a sole proprietor, and vice versa. The
following factors do not affect whether a sole proprietor is a Type 1 entity:
\itemize{
\item Multiple office locations
\item Having employees
\item Having an EIN
}

\strong{Type 2}: Organizational providers are eligible for \emph{Entity Type 2} NPIs.

Organizational or Group providers may have a single employee or thousands of employees.
An example is an \strong{incorporated individual} who is an organization's only
employee.

Some organization health care providers are made up of parts that work
somewhat independently from
their parent organization. These parts may offer different types of health
care or offer health care in separate physical locations. These parts and
their physical locations aren't themselves legal entities but are part of
the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity). The NPI
Final Rule refers to the parts and locations as sub-parts. An organization
health care provider can get its sub-parts their own NPIs. If a sub-part
conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (separately from its
parent), it must get its own NPI. Sub-part determination makes sure that
entities within a covered organization are uniquely identified in HIPAA
standard transactions they conduct with Medicare and other covered entities.
For example, a hospital offers acute care, laboratory, pharmacy, and
rehabilitation services. Each of these sub-parts may need its own NPI because
each sends its own standard transactions to one or more health plans. Sub-part
delegation doesn't affect Entity Type 1 health care providers. As individuals,
these health care providers can't choose sub-parts and are not sub-parts.

\strong{Authorized Official} \if{html}{\out{<br>}}
An appointed official (e.g., chief executive officer, chief financial officer,
general partner, chairman of the board, or direct owner) to whom the
organization has granted the legal authority to enroll it in the Medicare
program, to make changes or updates to the organization's status in the
Medicare program, and to commit the organization to fully abide by the
statutes, regulations, and program instructions of the Medicare program.
