\arguments{
\item{npi}{10-digit National Provider Identifier (NPI).}

\item{entype}{Entity type. Choices are either \code{I} for an Individual provider
or \code{O} for an Organizational provider. Cannot be the only criteria entered.}

\item{first_name}{Individual provider's first name. Trailing wildcard
entries are permitted requiring at least two characters to be entered
(e.g. \verb{jo*} ).}

\item{last_name}{Individual provider's last name. Trailing wildcard
entries are permitted requiring at least two characters to be entered
(e.g. \verb{jo*} ).}

\item{org_name}{Healthcare organization's name (NPI-2). Trailing wildcard entries are
permitted requiring at least two characters to be entered. All types of
Organization Names (LBN, DBA, Former LBN, Other Name) associated with an
NPI are examined for matching contents, therefore, the results might
contain an organization name different from the one entered in the
Organization Name criterion.}

\item{purpose_name}{Refers to whether the name information entered pertains
to an Authorized Official's name or a Provider's name. When not specified,
the results will search against a provider's first and last name. AO will
only search against Authorized Official names. While PROVIDER will only
search against Provider name. Valid values are: \code{AO} and \code{Provider.}}

\item{taxonomy_desc}{Search for providers by their taxonomy by entering the
taxonomy description.}

\item{city}{City associated with the provider's address. To search for a
Military Address, enter either \code{APO} or \code{FPO}.}

\item{state}{State abbreviation associated with the provider's address. If
this field is used, at least one other field, besides the \code{entype} and
\code{country}, must be populated. Valid values for state abbreviations:
\href{https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/help-api/state}{State Abbreviations}.}

\item{zipcode}{The Postal Code associated with the provider's address
identified in Address Purpose. If you enter a 5 digit postal code, it
will match any appropriate 9 digit (zip+4) codes in the data. Trailing
wildcard entries are permitted requiring at least two characters to be
entered (e.g., \verb{21*}).}

\item{country}{Country abbreviation associated with the provider's
address. This field \strong{can} be used as the only input criterion, as long
as the value selected \emph{is not} \strong{US} (United States). Valid values for
country abbreviations:
\href{https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/help-api/country}{Country Abbreviations}.}

\item{limit}{Maximum number of results to return; default is 1200.}

\item{skip}{Number of results to skip after searching
the previous number; set in \code{limit}.}

\item{tidy}{Tidy output; default is \code{TRUE}.}

\description{
\code{nppes()} allows you to search the National Plan and Provider Enumeration
System (NPPES) NPI Registry's public API. Th Registry is a free directory of
all active National Provider Identifier (NPI) records.

\strong{National Provider Identifier}
Healthcare providers acquire their unique 10-digit NPIs to identify
themselves in a standard way throughout their industry. Once CMS supplies
an NPI, they publish the parts of the NPI record that have public relevance,
including the providerâ€™s name, taxonomy and practice address.

\strong{Enumeration Type}
Two categories of health care providers exist for NPI enumeration purposes:

\strong{Entity Type 1}
Individual health care providers (including sole proprietors) may get an
NPI as \strong{Entity Type 1}. As a sole proprietor, they must apply for the NPI
using their own SSN, not an Employer Identification Number (EIN) even if
they have an EIN. As a sole proprietor, they may get only one NPI, just like
any other individual. The following factors \strong{do not} affect whether a sole
proprietor is an Entity Type 1:
\itemize{
\item Number of different office locations
\item Whether they have employees
\item Whether the IRS issued them an EIN
}

An \strong{incorporated individual} is a single health care provider who forms
and conducts business under a corporation. A sole proprietor \strong{is not} an
incorporated individual because the sole proprietor didn't form a
corporation. If you're a sole/solo practitioner, it doesn't necessarily mean
you're a sole proprietor, and vice versa. If you're an individual health care
provider who's incorporated, you may need to get an NPI for yourself
(Entity Type 1) and an NPI for your corporation or LLC (Entity Type 2).

\strong{Entity Type 2}
Organizational health care providers are group health care providers eligible
for NPIs as Entity Type 2. Organization health care providers may have a
single employee or thousands of employees. An example is an incorporated
individual who is an organization's only employee. Some organization health
care providers are made up of parts that work somewhat independently from
their parent organization. These parts may offer different types of health
care or offer health care in separate physical locations. These parts and
their physical locations aren't themselves legal entities but are part of
the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity). The NPI
Final Rule refers to the parts and locations as sub-parts. An organization
health care provider can get its sub-parts their own NPIs. If a sub-part
conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (separately from its
parent), it must get its own NPI. Sub-part determination makes sure that
entities within a covered organization are uniquely identified in HIPAA
standard transactions they conduct with Medicare and other covered entities.
For example, a hospital offers acute care, laboratory, pharmacy, and
rehabilitation services. Each of these sub-parts may need its own NPI because
each sends its own standard transactions to one or more health plans. Sub-part
delegation doesn't affect Entity Type 1 health care providers. As individuals,
these health care providers can't choose sub-parts and are not sub-parts.

\strong{Authorized Official}
An appointed official (e.g., chief executive officer, chief financial officer,
general partner, chairman of the board, or direct owner) to whom the
organization has granted the legal authority to enroll it in the Medicare
program, to make changes or updates to the organization's status in the
Medicare program, and to commit the organization to fully abide by the
statutes, regulations, and program instructions of the Medicare program.
