by CMS to US healthcare providers through NPPES.}

or \code{O} for Organizational (NPI-2)}

\item{first, last}{\verb{<chr>} \strong{WC} Individual provider's first and/or last name}

\item{organization}{\verb{<chr>} \strong{WC} Organizational provider's name. Many types
of names (LBN, DBA, Former LBN, Other Name) may match. As such, the results
might contain a name different from the one entered.}

\item{name_type}{\verb{<chr>} Type of individual the \code{first} and \code{last} name
parameters refer to; one of either \code{AO} for Authorized Officials or
\code{Provider} for Individual Providers.}

\item{taxonomy_desc}{\verb{<chr>} Provider's taxonomy description, e.g.
\code{Pharmacist}, \code{Pediatrics}}

\item{city}{\verb{<chr>} City name. For military addresses, search for either
\code{APO} or \code{FPO}.}

\item{state}{\verb{<chr>} 2-character state abbreviation. If it is the only input,
one other parameter besides \code{entype} and \code{country} is required.}

\item{zip}{\verb{<chr>} \strong{WC} 5- to 9-digit zip code, without a hyphen.}

\item{country}{\verb{<chr>} 2-character country abbreviation. Can be the only
input, as long as it \emph{is not} \code{US}.}

\item{limit}{\verb{<int>} Maximum number of results to return; \strong{default} is

\section{\strong{National Provider Identifier (NPI)}}{
 Healthcare providers acquire
their unique 10-digit NPIs to identify themselves in a standard way
throughout their industry. Once CMS supplies an NPI, they publish the parts
of the NPI record that have public relevance, including the providerâ€™s
name, taxonomy and practice address.
}

\section{\strong{Entity/Enumeration Type}}{
 Two categories of health care providers
exist for NPI enumeration purposes:

\strong{Type 1}: Individual providers may get an NPI as \emph{Entity Type 1}.

\emph{Sole Proprietorship} A sole proprietor is one who does not conduct
business as a corporation and, thus, \strong{is not} an incorporated individual.

An \strong{incorporated individual} is an individual provider who forms and
conducts business under a corporation. This provider may have a Type 1 NPI
while the corporation has its own Type 2 NPI.

A solo practitioner is not necessarily a sole proprietor, and vice versa.
The following factors do not affect whether a sole proprietor is a Type 1
entity: + Multiple office locations + Having employees + Having an EIN

\strong{Type 2}: Organizational providers are eligible for \emph{Entity Type 2} NPIs.

Organizational or Group providers may have a single employee or thousands
of employees. An example is an \strong{incorporated individual} who is an
organization's only employee.

Some organization health care providers are made up of parts that work
somewhat independently from their parent organization. These parts may
offer different types of health care or offer health care in separate
physical locations. These parts and their physical locations aren't
themselves legal entities but are part of the organization health care
provider (which is a legal entity). The NPI Final Rule refers to the parts
and locations as sub-parts. An organization health care provider can get
its sub-parts their own NPIs. If a sub-part conducts any HIPAA standard
transactions on its own (separately from its parent), it must get its own
NPI. Sub-part determination makes sure that entities within a covered
organization are uniquely identified in HIPAA standard transactions they
conduct with Medicare and other covered entities. For example, a hospital
offers acute care, laboratory, pharmacy, and rehabilitation services. Each
of these sub-parts may need its own NPI because each sends its own standard
transactions to one or more health plans. Sub-part delegation doesn't
affect Entity Type 1 health care providers. As individuals, these health
care providers can't choose sub-parts and are not sub-parts.

\strong{Authorized Official} \if{html}{\out{<br>}}
An appointed official (e.g., chief executive officer, chief financial
officer, general partner, chairman of the board, or direct owner) to whom
the organization has granted the legal authority to enroll it in the
Medicare program, to make changes or updates to the organization's status
in the Medicare program, and to commit the organization to fully abide by
the statutes, regulations, and program instructions of the Medicare
program.
