\description{
\code{nppes()} allows you to search the National Plan and Provider Enumeration
System (NPPES) NPI Registry's public API, a free directory of all active
National Provider Identifier (NPI) records.

\strong{National Provider Identifier} \if{html}{\out{<br>}}
Healthcare providers acquire their unique 10-digit NPIs to identify
themselves in a standard way throughout their industry. Once CMS supplies
an NPI, they publish the parts of the NPI record that have public relevance,
including the providerâ€™s name, taxonomy and practice address.

\strong{Enumeration Type} \if{html}{\out{<br>}}
Two categories of health care providers exist for NPI enumeration purposes:

\strong{Entity Type 1} \if{html}{\out{<br>}}
Individual health care providers (including sole proprietors) may get an
NPI as \strong{Entity Type 1}. As a sole proprietor, they must apply for the NPI
using their own SSN, not an Employer Identification Number (EIN) even if
they have an EIN. As a sole proprietor, they may get only one NPI, just like
any other individual. The following factors \strong{do not} affect whether a sole
proprietor is an Entity Type 1:
\itemize{
\item Number of different office locations
\item Whether they have employees
\item Whether the IRS issued them an EIN
}

An \strong{incorporated individual} is a single health care provider who forms
and conducts business under a corporation. A sole proprietor \strong{is not} an
incorporated individual because the sole proprietor didn't form a
corporation. If you're a sole/solo practitioner, it doesn't necessarily mean
you're a sole proprietor, and vice versa. If you're an individual health care
provider who's incorporated, you may need to get an NPI for yourself
(Entity Type 1) and an NPI for your corporation or LLC (Entity Type 2).\if{html}{\out{
<br>
}}


\strong{Entity Type 2} \if{html}{\out{<br>}}
Organizational health care providers are group health care providers eligible
for NPIs as Entity Type 2. Organization health care providers may have a
single employee or thousands of employees. An example is an incorporated
individual who is an organization's only employee. Some organization health
care providers are made up of parts that work somewhat independently from
their parent organization. These parts may offer different types of health
care or offer health care in separate physical locations. These parts and
their physical locations aren't themselves legal entities but are part of
the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity). The NPI
Final Rule refers to the parts and locations as sub-parts. An organization
health care provider can get its sub-parts their own NPIs. If a sub-part
conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (separately from its
parent), it must get its own NPI. Sub-part determination makes sure that
entities within a covered organization are uniquely identified in HIPAA
standard transactions they conduct with Medicare and other covered entities.
For example, a hospital offers acute care, laboratory, pharmacy, and
rehabilitation services. Each of these sub-parts may need its own NPI because
each sends its own standard transactions to one or more health plans. Sub-part
delegation doesn't affect Entity Type 1 health care providers. As individuals,
these health care providers can't choose sub-parts and are not sub-parts.

\strong{Authorized Official} \if{html}{\out{<br>}}
An appointed official (e.g., chief executive officer, chief financial officer,
general partner, chairman of the board, or direct owner) to whom the
organization has granted the legal authority to enroll it in the Medicare
program, to make changes or updates to the organization's status in the
Medicare program, and to commit the organization to fully abide by the
statutes, regulations, and program instructions of the Medicare program.

description with \emph{Trailing Wildcard Allowed}. Wildcard entries require at least two characters to be entered, e.g. \code{"jo*"}
