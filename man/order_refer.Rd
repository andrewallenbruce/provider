\description{
\code{order_refer()} returns a provider's eligibility status concerning ordering
and referring within Medicare to:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Part B}: Clinical Laboratory Services, Imaging Services
\item \strong{DME}: Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS)
\item \strong{Part A}: Home Health Services
}

To be eligible, a provider must:
\itemize{
\item have an \emph{Individual} NPI
\item be enrolled in Medicare in either an \emph{Approved} or \emph{Opt-Out} status
\item be of an \emph{Eligible Specialty} type
}

\strong{Ordering Providers} can order non-physician services for patients.

\strong{Referring (or Certifying) Providers} can request items or services that
Medicare may reimburse on behalf of its beneficiaries.

\strong{Opt-Out Providers}: Providers who have opted out of Medicare may still
order and refer. They can also enroll solely to order and refer.
