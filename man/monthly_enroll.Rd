\description{
Current information on the number of Medicare
beneficiaries with hospital/medical coverage and prescription

}
\details{
The Medicare Monthly Enrollment data provides current
monthly information on the number of Medicare beneficiaries
with hospital/medical coverage and prescription drug coverage,
available for several geographic areas including national,
state/territory, and county. The hospital/medical coverage
data can be broken down further by health care delivery
(Original Medicare versus Medicare Advantage and Other
Health Plans) and the prescription drug coverage data can
be examined by those enrolled in stand-alone Prescription
Drug Plans and those enrolled in Medicare Advantage
Prescription Drug plans. The dataset includes enrollee
counts on a rolling 12 month basis and also provides
information on yearly trends. The dataset is based on
information gathered from CMS administrative enrollment
data for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare program
available from the CMS Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse.
