\arguments{
\item{npi}{An NPI is a 10-digit unique numeric identifier that all providers
must obtain before enrolling in Medicare. It is assigned to health care
providers upon application through the National Plan and Provider
Enumeration System (NPPES).}

\item{pac_id}{Provider associate level variable (PAC ID) from PECOS
database used to link across tables. A PAC ID is a 10-digit unique
numeric identifier that is assigned to each individual or organization
in PECOS. All entity-level information (e.g., tax identification numbers
and organizational names) is linked through the PAC ID. A PAC ID may be
associated with multiple Enrollment IDs if the individual or
organization enrolled multiple times under different circumstances.}

\item{enroll_id}{Provider enrollment ID from PECOS database used to link
across tables. An Enrollment ID is a 15-digit unique alphanumeric
identifier that is assigned to each new provider enrollment application.
All enrollment-level information (e.g., enrollment type, enrollment
state, provider specialty and reassignment of benefits) is linked
through the Enrollment ID.}

\item{specialty_code}{Provider enrollment application and enrollment
specialty type. This field shows the providerâ€™s primary specialty code.
For practitioners and DME suppliers, please see the Secondary Specialty
file for a list of secondary specialties (when applicable). Only about
20\% of practitioners and DME suppliers have at least one secondary
specialty.}

\item{specialty_desc}{Provider enrollment application and enrollment
specialty type description}

\item{state}{Provider enrollment state, abbreviated location. Providers
enroll at the state level, so one PAC ID may be associated with multiple
ENRLMT_IDs and multiple STATE_CD values.}

\item{first_name}{Individual provider first name}

\item{middle_name}{Individual provider middle name}

\item{last_name}{Individual provider last name}

\item{org_name}{Organizational provider name}

\item{gender}{Individual provider gender;
\code{F} (female), \code{M} (male), \code{9} (unknown)}

\item{clean_names}{Convert column names to snakecase; default is \code{TRUE}.}
